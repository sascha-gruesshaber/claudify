**Run the gates the way CI runs them, before you claim anything passes.** They are recorded in
`.agents/gates.md`, at the repository root — the commands, their order, and which of them a local run
weakens. Read that file; do not reconstruct the gate from what you see in the tree.

- **Run them in the order given.** A formatter after a build check wastes the check, and most orders are
  written down because somebody already lost an hour to the other one.
- **A local command that is not the CI command is not the gate.** Where `.agents/gates.md` says a local
  invocation is softer than CI's — warnings not fatal, a subset of projects, coverage not measured — run
  the CI form or say which one you ran.
- **Generated files are built once, at integration.** `.agents/gates.md` names them. Never regenerate one
  inside a per-ticket worktree; every parallel tree would rewrite the same file.
- **A gate that fails for a reason outside this change is not yours to work around.** Say so and stop.
- **When a gate fails in a way that makes no sense**, read the troubleshooting document
  `.agents/gates.md` points at before debugging your own code.

If `.agents/gates.md` is missing, run the repo's obvious test and build commands, **say which you chose
and that they were not configured**, and do not claim CI parity.
