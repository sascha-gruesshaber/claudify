**How much a call is allowed to cost is configured, not improvised.** `.agents/lifecycle.md` § *Effort
and budget* sets, per role: the **model tier**, the **reasoning effort**, and a **soft output ceiling**.
Read it before dispatching, and pass the tier and effort you find there.

Four levers, in the order they actually move cost:

1. **How many calls** — the lens count. Six lenses cost three times two lenses, and this is the largest
   lever by a distance.
2. **Which tier** — a cheap tier on a call whose shape is already written down.
3. **How much effort** — reasoning effort per call, independent of tier.
4. **The output ceiling** — how long a report may run.

**The ceiling is an instruction to the callee, not an enforced limit.** So it is written as a
consequence, and the consequence is never "skim":

> Stay under about `<n>` output tokens. **If the work does not fit, return `reviewer-uncertainty` and say
> what you did not reach — never a shallow pass inside the budget.**

A truncated report that reads as complete is the one outcome worse than an expensive one, because the
caller cannot tell the difference and ships on it.

Two rules that keep a budget honest:

- **Report what a phase cost** when the run is over: calls made, tier each ran on, and anything that hit
  its ceiling. A budget nobody measures is a preference.
- **A budget is a default, not a cap on judgement.** Where a call genuinely needs more — a diff far past
  what one lens can hold, a security lens over a permission change — take the higher tier and **say in
  one line that you did and why.** Silently overspending and silently underspending are the same defect.

**A budget is tight because of the subscription, not the repo**, so `.agents/lifecycle.md` records which
plan is paying and which profile was taken. When it says a lens was dropped for **cost** rather than
relevance, do not helpfully add it back.

If `.agents/lifecycle.md` sets no budget, say so once and use the defaults in this document's own model
table.
