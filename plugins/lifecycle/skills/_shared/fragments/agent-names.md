**These agents ship inside this plugin, so their `subagent_type` carries the plugin prefix:**
`lifecycle:code-scout`, `lifecycle:spec-reviewer`, `lifecycle:change-reviewer`,
`lifecycle:ticket-implementer`, `lifecycle:finding-fixer`, `lifecycle:operator-view`.

A bare name may resolve, and it may also pick up a different agent the repo happens to define. **Pass
the prefixed form.** Where this document links an agent by file, the prefixed name is what goes in the
dispatch.
