# Plan check (a plan → a verdict)

Review a plan **before it is built**, the way a code review works after.

A plan is a **prediction, and nothing compiles it.** Its claims about the codebase are true when written
and quietly rot. So this skill spends its effort on the one thing a reader cannot do quickly by eye:
**checking the plan's assertions against the repository as it is now.**

<!-- shared:repo-config:start source=repo-config.md -->
**This repo describes itself in `.agents/`, at the repository root. Read the files that bind your step,
and treat them as authority over anything you would otherwise assume.**

| File | Answers |
|---|---|
| `.agents/lifecycle.md` | which phases run, which review lenses are in use, how many rounds each loop gets, how wide a wave may be |
| `.agents/gates.md` | the commands that must pass, in order, and what "green" means here |
| `.agents/tracker.md` | where specs and tickets live, and what may be written to the board |
| `.agents/forge.md` | the git host, and how a branch becomes a reviewed change |
| `.agents/docs.md` | where architecture truth lives, the glossary, and what "docs are part of done" costs |
| `.agents/naming.md` | branch, commit, directory and test-name grammar |
| `.agents/working-agreement.md` | working hours, what may run unattended, how to report, when to stop and ask |

Three rules:

- **A missing file is a real answer: that thing is not configured here.** Say so in one line and take
  the safest reading — do not invent the repo's conventions, and do not fall back on another project's.
  If the whole directory is absent, stop and tell the user to run `/onboard` instead of guessing.
- **`.agents/` beats your own judgement, and loses to the user.** It was written deliberately, so a rule
  you disagree with is reported once, not routed around.
- **Read only what your step needs.** Every line costs on every turn of a long run.
<!-- shared:repo-config:end -->

## When NOT to use

- To review code that exists → the review lenses in [`build`](../build/SKILL.md).
- On a change too small to have had a plan.
- To settle an open design question the plan rests on → [`grill`](../grill/SKILL.md) first. A plan
  review cannot tell you what the user wanted.

## Step 1 — Read both documents

The plan and **the spec it argues from**. The spec is the binding authority; the plan is its argument.
Where they disagree, the spec wins and the disagreement is a finding.

## Step 2 — Send the lenses

Spawn [`change-reviewer`](../../agents/change-reviewer.md) once per axis below, **all in one message**,
each on `sonnet` unless the plan touches auth, tenancy, migrations, permissions or a wire contract —
then the coverage and risk axes go to `opus`.

Hand each one the plan path and the spec path. **Never paste either into the prompt.**

<!-- shared:no-prejudging:start source=no-prejudging.md -->
**Never tell a reviewer what not to flag.** If the prompt you are writing contains "do not flag", "don't
treat X as a defect", "at most Minor", or "the spec chose this" — stop. You are pre-judging, and the
reason is almost always to spare yourself a review round.

Let the reviewer raise it. Adjudicate it afterwards, in the open, and record the ruling.

Two rules that follow:

- **Do not add open-ended directives** — "check all uses", "run the race tests if useful" — without a
  concrete, task-specific reason. They cost a reviewer's whole budget and return nothing.
- **Do not ask a reviewer to re-run tests the implementer already ran on the same code.** The
  implementer's report carries that evidence.

**Triage is the caller's job, not the reviewer's.** A reviewer that filters while it looks leaves buckets
empty for the wrong reason: cover first, filter second, and judge severity as a separate pass over a list
that already exists.
<!-- shared:no-prejudging:end -->
<!-- shared:budget:start source=budget.md -->
**How much a call is allowed to cost is configured, not improvised.** `.agents/lifecycle.md` § *Effort
and budget* sets, per role: the **model tier**, the **reasoning effort**, and a **soft output ceiling**.
Read it before dispatching, and pass the tier and effort you find there.

Four levers, in the order they actually move cost:

1. **How many calls** — the lens count. Six lenses cost three times two lenses, and this is the largest
   lever by a distance.
2. **Which tier** — a cheap tier on a call whose shape is already written down.
3. **How much effort** — reasoning effort per call, independent of tier.
4. **The output ceiling** — how long a report may run.

**The ceiling is an instruction to the callee, not an enforced limit.** So it is written as a
consequence, and the consequence is never "skim":

> Stay under about `<n>` output tokens. **If the work does not fit, return `reviewer-uncertainty` and say
> what you did not reach — never a shallow pass inside the budget.**

A truncated report that reads as complete is the one outcome worse than an expensive one, because the
caller cannot tell the difference and ships on it.

Two rules that keep a budget honest:

- **Report what a phase cost** when the run is over: calls made, tier each ran on, and anything that hit
  its ceiling. A budget nobody measures is a preference.
- **A budget is a default, not a cap on judgement.** Where a call genuinely needs more — a diff far past
  what one lens can hold, a security lens over a permission change — take the higher tier and **say in
  one line that you did and why.** Silently overspending and silently underspending are the same defect.

If `.agents/lifecycle.md` sets no budget, say so once and use the defaults in this document's own model
table.
<!-- shared:budget:end -->

## The eight axes

1. **Coverage.** The plan delivers the spec in full. Name anything the spec asks for that no task
   touches. A plan silent about part of its spec has not deferred that part — it has lost it.

2. **Claims about the codebase.** A plan is mostly assertions: this file exists, that handler is the
   template, this behaviour is missing, there are five call sites. **Every one is checkable, and you are
   the last person who can check them cheaply.** Open every `path:line` the plan cites. Report each
   claim with **the command you ran and what it printed**. Pay particular attention to:
   - *"already exists" / "already implemented"* — if true the task should not exist; if false the plan
     is missing work;
   - *counts* — "the five sites" that nobody confirmed should have read "every site";
   - *negative claims* — "nothing else calls this" needs a repository-wide search, and these are the
     assertions most often carried over from a stale reading.

3. **Convention compliance.** Against **this** repository's rules, not a generic standard — everything
   `.agents/docs.md` names: the glossary, the conventions, the documented seams, the accepted decisions.
   A documented seam and an accepted decision are **constraints, not suggestions.**

4. **Executability.** Every task names its files and how it will be verified. No placeholders —
   "implement the handler" is not a task and `TODO` in a plan is a defect. Every command runnable as
   written, with no machine-specific path and no credential that will not exist elsewhere.

5. **Sequencing and interfaces.** Task N can run once N−1 is done, and each task leaves the tree
   building. **Cross-check every `Consumes` against the matching `Produces`** — a name or a type that
   does not line up is the conflict that shows up at integration, and it is free to find here.

6. **Risk and blast radius.** Migrations, permissions and tenancy, public contracts, message schemas,
   deploy ordering, backward compatibility. Ask what happens if this ships half-applied, because sooner
   or later something will.

7. **Testability.** The tests the plan names actually observe the behaviour, at a seam that exists or
   that the plan creates deliberately. Reject any test whose expected value is computed the way the code
   computes it — it passes by construction and can never disagree with the implementation. Check the
   plan clears the coverage floor in `.agents/gates.md`.

8. **Scope.** Work the spec did not ask for, work it asked for that is missing, and work that
   re-implements something the codebase already has. All three are findings, and **the third is the one
   a plan review is uniquely placed to catch** — after implementation it just looks like code.

## Step 3 — The conflict table

Separately from the lenses, build one table yourself. It is cheap and it catches what per-axis review
cannot see.

- **One row for every pair of tasks that share a file or an interface** — the two tasks, what one
  produces against what the other consumes, and what you found.
- **One row for every task** — whether its own text agrees with itself: the tests it specifies against
  the code it specifies, the files it creates against the files it later touches.

**"The scan is clean" without those rows is not a scan you ran.** Write the table into the report even
when every row says "no conflict".

<!-- shared:evidence-before-claims:start source=evidence-before-claims.md -->
**If you have not run the command in this message, you cannot say it passes.**

Before any statement that work is done, fixed, passing or ready:

1. Name the command that would prove the claim.
2. Run it in full. Not a subset, not a remembered earlier run.
3. Read the whole output and the exit code.
4. State the claim **with** the evidence, or state what actually happened.

| Claim | What proves it | What does not |
|---|---|---|
| tests pass | the test command's output, 0 failures | a previous run, "should pass" |
| build succeeds | exit 0 from the build | the linter passing |
| lint clean | the linter's output, 0 errors | a partial check |
| the bug is fixed | the original symptom, retested | the code changed |
| the agent finished | `git diff` / `git log` in its tree | the agent reporting success |
| the requirement is met | that requirement checked by name | the suite being green |

**Report what happened, not what you hoped.** A failing gate is reported with its output. A skipped step
is reported as skipped. Words that imply success without evidence — "should", "probably", "looks
right" — are the same violation as claiming it outright.
<!-- shared:evidence-before-claims:end -->

## Step 4 — The verdict

Write `plan-check.md` beside the plan and commit it with the plan.

```markdown
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Plan:** `<path to plan.md>`
**Verdict:** Ready to build | Ready with changes | Not ready
**Lenses:** coverage, claims, conventions, executability, sequencing, risk, testability, scope
**Claims checked:** <n> confirmed · <n> contradicted · <n> could not verify

## Blocking
- <finding> — <task heading it lands on> — <what to do about it>

## Changes to make first
- ...

## Claims
| Claim | Command run | Result |
|---|---|---|
| "the handler is at X" | `rg -n "class X" src/` | confirmed, `src/…:120` |
| "nothing else calls this" | `rg -n "Foo\(" -g '!**/obj/**'` | **contradicted** — 3 call sites |

## Task conflicts
| Tasks | Shared | Found |
|---|---|---|

## Not verified
- <what nobody could check, and why>
```

**A finding cites a task heading, not a `file:line`.** The code does not exist yet.

**A reviewer that verified nothing is a failed reviewer**, however well written its report. Checking
claims against the repository is the axis this skill exists for; a lens that returned reasoning instead
of evidence contributed neither. Say so in the report rather than counting it.

**A contradicted claim is never a wording fix.** The plan asserted something false, so the reasoning
resting on it has not been done — that area gets re-scouted, not re-worded.

## Chat summary

The verdict in the first line. Then the blocking count, the claim counts, and the single most expensive
thing found. Then: `/build` on Ready, `/plan` again on Not ready.

**The re-plan cap is in `.agents/lifecycle.md`** — typically one, then get a person. A plan that fails
twice has something wrong with its premises, and a re-plan loop is unusually cheap to get stuck in.

## Dispatching the agents

<!-- shared:agent-names:start source=agent-names.md -->
**These agents ship inside this plugin, so their `subagent_type` carries the plugin prefix:**
`lifecycle:code-scout`, `lifecycle:spec-reviewer`, `lifecycle:change-reviewer`,
`lifecycle:ticket-implementer`, `lifecycle:finding-fixer`, `lifecycle:operator-view`.

A bare name may resolve, and it may also pick up a different agent the repo happens to define. **Pass
the prefixed form.** Where this document links an agent by file, the prefixed name is what goes in the
dispatch.
<!-- shared:agent-names:end -->
